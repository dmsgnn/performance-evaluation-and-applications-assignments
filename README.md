# Performance Evaluation and Applications assignments

These assignments have been developed for the "Performance Evaluation and Applications" course, attended during my Master of Science (A.Y. 2022/23) at the Polytechnic University of Milan. The highest possible final grade has been achieved: 30 cum Laude.

## Description

The course evaluation was based on several assignments aimed to verify the understanding of the course topics, such as performance indices and measures, workload and service characterization, analytical models, and simulation and resource contention. In addition, a final project has been assigned, which consisted in a pilot system that had to be studied using the tools and techniques discussed during the course.

## Repository structure

The repository contains two major folders, the [assignments](/Assignments/) folder contains all the assignments completed throughout the course, while the [project](/Project/) folder contains the final project of the course.

Each assignment's folder contains the following elements:
1. problem specification, including the list of files to be delivered
2. traces or logs needed to solve the problem
3. deliverables folder, contaning the script used to solve the assignment and/or the JSIM file of the system analysed

The project folder instead contains the project [presentation](/Project/Projects%202022-2023.pdf), the system's [traces](/Project/Traces/) and a [deliverables](/Project/Project%20deliverables/) folder, containing the script and JSIM files used to solve the problem and a final [report](/Project/Project%20deliverables/Performance_evaluation_and_application_project_report.pdf) describing how the project has been faced and which techniques have been used.
